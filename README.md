# Huffman-Code
This is an attempt to compute the minimum variance Huffman Code for a given source.

Enter the list of probabilities to various symbols(binary) of the source. <br/>
The output Huffman code will correspond to symbols in descending order of their probability.

Working:<br/>
i:   Run the File huffmanCode.py<br/>
ii:  If {p1,p2,p3,p4} are the probabilities corresponding to symbols {s1,s2,s3,s4},<br/> 
     give the input as [p1,p2,p3,p4] (not necessarily in ascending/descending order)<br/>
     <br/>
The output of the code is the following:<br/>
i:   Minimum variance Huffman Code<br/>
ii:  Average length of the code<br/>
iii: Entropy of the source<br/>
iv:  Variance of the code<br/>
v:   Efficiency of the code.<br/>
