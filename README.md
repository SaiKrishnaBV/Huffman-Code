# Huffman-Code
This is an attempt to compute the minimum variance Huffman Code for a given source.

Enter the list of probabilities to various symbols(binary) of the source. 
The output Huffman code will correspond to symbols in descending order of their probability.

Working:
i:   Run the File huffmanCode.py\\
ii:  If {p1,p2,p3,p4} are the probabilities corresponding to {s1,s2,s3,s4}, 
     give the input as [p1,p2,p3,p4] (not necessarily in ascending/descending order)
     
The output of the code is the following:
i:   Minimum variance Huffman Code
ii:  Average length of the code
iii: Entropy of the system
iv:  Variance of the code
v:   Efficiency of the code.
